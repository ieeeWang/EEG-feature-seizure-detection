# EEG-feature-seizure-detection
EEG feature engineering for epileptic seizure detection

This repo records the commonly used EEG features for the epileptic seizure detection task. Here, only the MATLAB codes for the feature engineering part are described. There codes were used by the papers below. And for the classification procedure (i.e., seizure detection), please also refer to the following papers.
